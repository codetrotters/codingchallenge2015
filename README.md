We are looking forward to read all your solutions!

##Challenge

Write a function called **int_to_word** that takes as an input an integer parameter and returns the associated English word. You can assume the function will never receive a number greater than 999,999,999.

You can code this on the programming language of your choice.

##Examples

```
int_to_word(4527)     == "four thousand five hundred twenty seven"
int_to_word(200017)   == "two hundred thousand seventeen"
int_to_word(784)      == "seven hundred eighty four"
int_to_word(1000215)  == "one million two hundred fifteen"
```
